   - Guest list management with categorization (family, friends, VIPs).
   - Invitation system with RSVP tracking.

3. Social Interaction Features:
   - Chat and messaging system for communication with guests (inspired by WeChat).
   - Photo and video sharing, with privacy controls.

4. Supply Chain and Vendor Management:

   - Efficient data handling and storage for smooth performance.
   - Scalable architecture to support additional features in the future.

Remember, developing an app with such a wide range of features requires a skilled development team knowledgeable in mobile and web app development, cloud infrastructure, and possibly AI for chat and recommendation systems. Additionally, understanding the cultural aspects of Khmer weddings is crucial to ensure the app is respectful and accurate in its representation.


Estimating the number of working hours per feature for your app, which involves Khmer traditional cultural events and AI integration, requires a detailed analysis of each component. Here's a rough estimate:

1. User Profile Management: 100-150 hours.
2. Event Planning and Management: 200-300 hours.
3. Social Interaction Features: 150-200 hours (excluding advanced AI features).
4. Supply Chain and Vendor Management: 250-350 hours.
5. Budget and Finance Management: 100-150 hours.
6. Cultural Content and Resources: 100-200 hours.
7. Scalability Considerations: 150-250 hours.

AI Chat and Recommendation System: Depending on the complexity, AI integration can take 200-400 hours.

Technical Expertise:
- Front-end Development: Expertise in UI/UX design, responsive design, and front-end programming.
- Back-end Development: Knowledge in database management, server-side programming, and API integration.

Total Estimated Hours: Approximately 1,250-2,000 hours. 

Cost Estimation: Multiply the total hours by the developer's hourly rate. Rates can vary significantly based on the geographical location and expertise level of the development team.

Business Plan: Consider initial development costs, ongoing maintenance, marketing, and operational expenses against potential revenue streams like subscriptions, transaction fees, and ads. To calculate the break-even point, divide the total fixed costs by the profit per unit (revenue per unit minus variable costs per unit).

Remember, these are rough estimates. It's advisable to consult with a software development company for a more precise quote and business analysis. Additionally, consider the cultural sensitivity and authenticity when dealing with traditional events.
